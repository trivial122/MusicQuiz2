# Discription:
This app contains a start page, where the user can enter his/her name. After clicking on start the activity changes to a quiz page. 
There are five questions with four answer option (RadioButton). For each correct answer the user gains 1 point. 
By clicking on submit after the quiz, the score is shown in a toast message.

There is also a info button on the start page, when clicked on it the activity changes to a info page with few details about the quiz.
